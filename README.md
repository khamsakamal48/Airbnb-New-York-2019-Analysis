# Airbnb New York (2019) Analysis

## Problem Statement
Suppose you are working as a data analyst at Airbnb. The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted Airbnb's business, resulting in a decline in revenue. With the easing of restrictions and the reopening of travel, Airbnb is eager to make a successful comeback. 

As a data analyst, your goal is to analyse data from property listings on Airbnb in New York from 2019 to derive insights and formulate recommendations to improve the company's revenue post-lockdown. You will utilise data analysis and data visualisation techniques you have learned in previous modules to provide valuable information to assist Airbnb in making informed decisions for its business revival.

## Audience
The primary audience for the analysis is the executive team at Airbnb. This includes key decision-makers and stakeholders responsible for strategizing the company's post-lockdown comeback. The executives are interested in data-driven insights that can guide decisions related to property listings, customer preferences, and overall revenue generation.

## End Product
The outcome of your data analysis will be a data analysis report presentation. This report will include visualisations, key insights, and actionable recommendations for the executive team to consider in their post-lockdown revival strategy.
